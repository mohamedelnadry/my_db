Constrained clustering formulations exist for popular algorithms such as k-means, mixture models, and spectral clustering but have several limitations. A fundamental strength of deep learning is its flexibility, and here we explore a deep learning framework for constrained clustering and in particular explore how it can extend the field of constrained clustering. We show that our framework can not only handle standard together/apart constraints (without the well documented negative effects reported earlier) generated from labeled side information but more complex constraints generated from new types of side information such as continuous values and high-level domain knowledge. Furthermore, we propose an efficient training paradigm that is generally applicable to these four types of constraints. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by empirical results on both image and text datasets. We also study the robustness of our framework when learning with noisy constraints and show how different components of our framework contribute to the final performance.

One of the sources for gaining valuable insight into public sentiment is through social media. This study aims to extract this insight by producing a list of the most discussed topics regarding COVID-19 on Twitter every week and monitoring the evolution of topics from week to week. This research will propose two topic mining that can handle a large-scale dataset\u2014rolling online non-negative matrix factorization (Rolling-ONMF) and sliding online non-negative matrix factorization (Sliding-ONMF)\u2014and compare the insights produced by both techniques. Each algorithm produces 425 topics over the course of 17 weeks. However, topics that have not evolved from one week to the next beyond a certain evolution threshold are consolidated into a single topic. Since the topics produced by the Rolling-ONMF algorithm each week depend on the topics from the previous week, we find that the Sliding-ONMF algorithm produces more varied topics each week; however, the topics produced by the Rolling-ONMF algorithm contain keywords that appear more consistent with each other when reviewing the terms manually. We also observe that the Sliding-ONMF algorithm is able to capture events that have shorter time frames rather than ones that last throughout many months while the Rolling-ONMF algorithm detects more general themes due to a higher average evolution score which leads to more topic consolidation. We have also conducted a qualitative analysis and grouped the detected topics into themes. A number of important themes such as government policy, economic crisis, COVID-19-related updates, COVID-19-related events, prevention, vaccines and treatments, and COVID-19 testing are identified.

Working directly with such graphs is difficult, and it has become common to use spectral techniques that embed graphs in a geometry, and then work with the geometry instead. In a good embedding, edges that are heavily (positively) weighted, and so represent strong interactions, cause the vertices they connect to be embedded close to one another. However, in some social networks, there are also antagonistic relationships that are naturally represented by negatively weighted edges. The resulting graphs are called signed social networks. Clearly, an embedding of such a signed social network should place nodes connected by positively weighted edges close together, but nodes connected by negatively weighted edges far apart.

To remedy this situation, deep learning networks have been recently developed for ultrasound image super-resolution (SR) because of the powerful approximation capability. However, most current supervised SR methods are not suitable for ultrasound medical images because the medical image samples are always rare, and usually, there are no low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) training pairs in reality. In this work, based on self-supervision and cycle generative adversarial network, we propose a new perception consistency ultrasound image SR method, which only requires the LR ultrasound data and can ensure the re-degenerated image of the generated SR one to be consistent with the original LR image, and vice versa.

Unfortunately, the model generated by LapSVM has a poor sparsity. A sparse decision model has always been fascinating because it could implement data reduction and improve performance. To generate a sparse model of LapSVM, we propose an $$\\ell _1$$ \u2113 1 -norm Laplacian support vector machine ( $$\\ell _1$$ \u2113 1 -norm LapSVM), which replaces the $$\\ell _2$$ \u2113 2 -norm with the $$\\ell _1$$ \u2113 1 -norm in LapSVM.

We discuss two situations for the $$\\ell _1$$ \u2113 1 -norm LapSVM, linear and nonlinear ones. In the linear $$\\ell _1$$ \u2113 1 -norm LapSVM, the sparse decision model implies that features with nonzero coefficients are contributive. In other words, the linear $$\\ell _1$$ \u2113 1 -norm LapSVM can perform feature selection to achieve the goal of data reduction. Moreover, the nonlinear (kernel) $$\\ell _1$$ \u2113 1 -norm LapSVM can also implement data reduction in terms of sample selection.

We further derive a Neural-Network model that jointly learns a new representation of users and items in an embedded space as well as the preference relation of users over the pairs of items. The learning objective is based on three scenarios of ranking losses that control the ability of the model to maintain the ordering over the items induced from the users\u2019 preferences, as well as, the capacity of the dot-product defined in the learned embedded space to produce the ordering. The proposed model is by nature suitable for implicit feedback and involves the estimation of only very few parameters. Through extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks on implicit data, we show the interest of learning the preference and the embedding simultaneously when compared to learning those separately.

Moreover, for new specific subject, the size of sample data is very small compared to that of existing subjects, which easily leads to overfitting in deep neural network training and reduces generalization performance of the network. In this paper, the deep multi-source adaptation transfer network (DMATN) is proposed for the new subjects in aBCI. In DMATN, the multi-source selection is employed to obtain the portion of existing EEG data mostly correlated with new subject and to decrease by two-fifth source data. To explore domain-invariant structures, deep adaptation network is used to map correlated source domain and the target domain (new subject) into reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) optimized by the multiple kernel variant of maximum mean discrepancies (MK-MMD). To more precisely predict the emotional state of the new subject, domain discriminator is applied in DMATN to make the data distribution of the two domains more similar.

However, the exploitation phase of the current Harris Hawks optimizer algorithm is poor. In the present research, an improved version of the Harris Hawks optimization algorithm, which combined HHO with Particle Swarm Optimization and named as ameliorated Harris Hawks optimizer algorithm, has been proposed to find the solution of various optimization problems such as nonlinear, non-convex and highly constrained engineering design problem. In the proposed research, the exploitation phase of the existing HHO algorithm is improved using a particle swarm optimization algorithm and its performance tested for CEC2005, CECE2017 and CEC2018 benchmark problems. Also, discrete algorithms such as FFT algorithms, convolution and image processing algorithm use multiply and accumulate (MAC) unit as a critical component. The efficiency of a MAC is mainly dependent upon the speed of operation, power dissipation and chip area along with the complexity level of the circuit. In this research paper, a power-efficient signed floating-point MAC (SFMAC) is proposed using universal compressor-based multiplier (UCM). Instead of having a complex design architecture, a simple multiplexer-based circuit is used to achieve signed floating output. The 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 SFMAC can take 8-bit mantissa and 3-bit exponent. And therefore, the input to the SFMAC can be in the range of \u2212\u2009(7.96875)_10 to +\u2009(7.96875)_10.

With such limited data source, existing techniques, such as statistical modelling or machine learning methods, fail to predict short time series effectively. To address this problem, this paper provides a global framework for short time series modelling predictions, integrating the rolling mechanism, grey model, and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. In addition, dragonfly algorithm and whale optimization algorithm are investigated and deployed to optimize the framework by enhancing its predicting accuracy with less computational costs. To verify the performance of the proposed framework, three industrial cases are introduced as simulation experiments in this paper.

Relieving labour intensive annotations using automatic labelling is thus an important research topic, seeking ways to obtain labelled data quickly and consistently. In this work, we propose an iterative deep learning NER framework using distant supervision for automatic labelling of domain-specific datasets. The framework is applied to mineral exploration reports and produced a large BIO-annotated dataset with six geological categories. This quality-labelled dataset, OzROCK, is made publicly available to support future research on technical domain NER. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, further confirmed by domain experts. The generalisation ability is verified by applying the framework to two other datasets: one for disease names and the other for chemical names.

As far as we know, nearly all existing relation extraction models assume that each sentence contains precisely one entity pair, i.e., two entities. However, in reality, the datasets constructed by distant supervision have lots of sentences which contain repeated entities. In other words, there may be more than two entities in a sentence. This phenomenon breaks the assumption of existing models and makes them inevitably encounter the attention bias problem; that is, the model focuses on the wrong entities during relation extraction. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we utilize the idea of ensemble learning and propose a novel distant supervised relation extraction model. The proposed model follows the multi-instance multi-label learning mechanism and conducts relation extraction based on the sentence-bag representations. Specifically, it first tries to identify the most critical entity and keywords, and then it uses voting mechanism to determine the sentence-level and bag-level features.

Moreover, TV systems can also improve the overall efficiency through an optimal torque distribution that also considers the power consumption. For such a complex control system with multiple objectives, intelligent control techniques have demonstrated to be one of the best alternatives. However, the works proposed in the literature do not handle both vehicle dynamics behaviour and energy efficiency, and generally do not consider the real-time implementability of the developed controllers. To overcome the aforementioned issues, in this work, a novel torque vectoring approach is proposed, which uses a neural network-based vertical tire forces estimator and considers the regenerative braking capabilities of EVs. Moreover, the implementability of the controller in a hetereogenous (FPGA and microcontroller) automotive suitable system on chip is addressed, ensuring its real-time capabilities.

In this paper, we present Leon+, an in-memory distributed framework, to address the RPQ problem in the context of the knowledge graph. To reduce search space and mitigate mounting communication costs, Leon+ takes advantage of join-ahead pruning via a novel RDF summarization technique together with a path partitioning strategy. We also develop a subtle cost model to devise query plans to achieve high efficiency for complex RPQs. As there has been no available RPQ benchmark, we create micro-benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. A thorough experimental evaluation is presented between our approach and the state-of-the-art RDF stores. The results show that our approach outperforms 5x faster than the competitors on single RPQ.

In recent years, this problem has been widely studied, and various query models have been proposed, such as top- k , skyline, k -regret and k -coverage queries. Among these models, the k -coverage query is an ideal query method; this model has stability, scale invariance and high traversal efficiency. However, current methods including k -coverage queries cannot deal with deleting some points from the dataset while providing an effective solution set efficiently. In this paper, we study the robustness of k -coverage queries in two cases involving the dynamic deletion of data points. The first case is when it is assumed that the whole dataset can be obtained in advance, while the second is when the data points arrive in a stream. For a centralized dataset, we introduce a sieving mechanism and use a precalculated threshold to filter a coreset from the entire dataset. Then, the k -coverage query can be carried out on this small coreset instead of the entire dataset, and we propose a threshold-based k -coverage query algorithm, which greatly accelerates query processing. For a streaming dataset, a special chain structure is adopted. Furthermore, a single-pass streaming algorithm named Robust-Sieving is proposed. Moreover, the coreset-based method is extended to answer the problem. In addition, sampling techniques are adopted to accelerate query processing under these two circumstances.

Compared to strategies between two agents, such as cooperation or noncooperation, strategies on multiple agents are rather challenging and difficult to be simulated via traditional methods. Particularly, in a knowledge spillover problem (KSP), cooperation strategies among more than hundreds of individuals need to be simulated. At the same time, the brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm, which is a data-driven and model-driven hybrid paradigm, has the potential to simulate the complex behaviors in a group of simple individuals. In this paper, a modified BSO algorithm has been used to solve KSP from the perspective of evolutionary game theory. Knowledge spillover (KS) is the sharing or exchanging of knowledge resources among individuals. Firstly, the KS and evolutionary game theory were introduced.

Thus, data-incompleteness is an important factor that causes degradation of the image quality. This work presents a method to solve the acoustic inverse problem of EPAT from incomplete measurements associated with the image formation process. This method combines the traditional variational iteration with convolutional neural network (CNN), in which the forward operator and adjoint operator of imaging are excluded from the network training and are embedded into each layer of the structural unit. The gradient information is utilized to reduce the influence of incomplete measurements on the image quality. The network is trained unit by unit in an adaptive way to achieve fast convergence.

Also, it is able to provide a generalization that can work across various noise levels in the data.

It is difficult to find a PPH in an earlier stage, so pregnant women are exposed to excess blood loss that makes them suffer and die. Antenatal practices help in identifying risk factors, and modern technology is used to overcome the risk. Still, the morbidity rate and the mortality arise due to the unpredicted and unexpected cause. PPH is still a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The novelty of this research work is to alert medical practitioner about excessive bleeding of pregnant women during childbirth. We are proposing an automation system using wearable devices to prevent pregnant women from the PPH. These devices measure parameters like temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, and sweat rate of pregnant women. Fuzzy neural technique-based rules are used for each parameter to predict the risk in developing PPH and to evaluate the performance of proposed system for reducing mortality and morbidity rates. Our findings of experiment are carried on metrics of HPPH (high-level postpartum haemorrhage), NPPH (normal-level postpartum haemorrhage), and MPPH (medium-level postpartum haemorrhage) for 15 patients.

However, such devices need to be worn by the patients all the time. These devices have limitations such as their battery lifetime, charging mechanism, and hardware-related cost. Moreover, these devices transmit a huge amount of redundant and inconsistent data. The transmitted data need to be fused to remove any outlier so that only highly- refined data are available for decision-making. In this paper, we use channel state information (CSI) to track the vital signs of a patient and remove any outliers from the gathered data. We monitor the respiration rate of a patient during sleep with minimal hardware-related cost. Our CSI-based approach no longer requires the patients to wear any wearables and can monitor even the minute fluctuations in a WiFi signal. For extracting useful features from the respiratory data, three types of feature extraction techniques are used. In order to select important features from the extracted feature space, three feature selection algorithms, i.e., Relief, mRMR, and Lasso, have been investigated. In addition, for predicting the health conditions of a patient, four machine learning classification algorithms, i.e., KNN, SVM, DT, and RF, are utilized.

In today\u2019s world, magnetic resonance imaging is used for determining the brain tumor types in an effective manner. The manual classification of brain tumor consumes more time and also applicable for a limited number of images, so a deep learning-based model is proposed in this research paper for automatic classification of brain tumor types. At first, the brain images are collected from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image dataset. Then, the normalization technique and histogram of oriented gradients are employed to improve the visible level of the collected raw brain images and to extract the feature vectors from the normalized brain images. The histogram descriptor effectively describes the edge and contour features of the images related to other feature descriptors. Further, the extracted features are given as the input to convolutional neural networks to classify meningiomas, gliomas, and pituitary tumors. The hard swish-based RELU activation function is included in convolutional neural networks that effectively improve the classification performance and learning speed.

Methods The\u00a0putative ingredients of ginger and its related targets were discerned from the TCMSP \u00a0and Swiss\u00a0target prediction database. After that, the targets interacting with colon cancer were collected using Genecards, OMIM, and Drugbank databases.

The PPI and compound-target-disease networks were constructed using Cytoscape\u00a03.8.1.\u00a0Finally, Discovery studio software was employed to confirm\u00a0the key genes and active components from ginger. Results Six potential active compounds, 285 interacting targets in addition to 1356 disease-related targets were collected, of which 118 intersection targets were obtained. A total of 34 key targets including PIK3CA, SRC, and TP53 were identified\u00a0through\u00a0PPI network analysis. These targets were mainly focused on the biological processes of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, cellular response to oxidative stress, and cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus. The KEGG enrichment manifested that three signaling pathways were closely related to colon cancer prevention of ginger, cancer, endocrine resistance, and hepatitis B pathways. TP53, HSP90AA1, and JAK2 were viewed as the most important genes, which were validated by molecular docking simulation.

In machine learning research, ensemble methods for classification tasks in imbalanced datasets have attracted a lot of attention due to their ability to improve classification performance. However, these methods are still prone to the negative effects of noise in the training sets. Furthermore, many of them alter the original class distribution to create a sort of balance in the datasets through over-sampling or undersampling techniques, which can lead to overfitting or discarding useful data, respectively, and thus may still hamper performance. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble method for classification that creates an arbitrary number of balanced splits (sBal) of data generated based on Instance Hardness as a weighting mechanism for creating balanced bags. Each of the generated bags will contain all the minority instances, and a mixture of majority instances with varying degrees of hardness (easy, normal, and hard), and we call this approach sBal_IH technique. This will enable base learners to train on different balanced bags comprising varied characteristics of the training data. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method on a total of 100 datasets that include 30 synthetic datasets with controlled levels of noise, 29 balanced and 41 imbalanced real-world datasets, and compared its performance with both traditional ensemble methods (Bagging, Wagging Random Forest, and AdaBoost), and those specialized for class imbalanced problems (Balanced Bagging, Balanced Random forest, RUSBoost, and Easy Ensemble).

Several Petabytes volumes of data are generated every second from different sources, which affect the stock market. A fair and efficient fusion of these data sources (factors) into intelligence is expected to offer better prediction accuracy on the stock market. However, integrating these factors from different data sources as one dataset for market analysis is seen as challenging because they come in a different format (numerical or text). In this study, we propose a novel multi-source information-fusion stock price prediction framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture (Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) named IKN-ConvLSTM. Precisely, we design a predictive framework to integrate stock-related information from six (6) heterogeneous sources. Secondly, we construct a base model using CNN, and random search algorithm as a feature selector to optimise our initial training parameters. Finally, a stacked LSTM network is fine-tuned by using the tuned parameter (features) from the base-model to enhance prediction accuracy.

The unavailability of vaccines for COVID-19 has rendered rapid testing of the population instrumental in order to contain the exponential rise in cases of infection. Shortage of RT-PCR test kits and delays in obtaining test results calls for alternative methods of rapid and reliable diagnosis. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based solution using chest X-rays which can help in rapid triaging of COVID-19 patients. The proposed solution uses image enhancement, image segmentation, and employs a modified stacked ensemble model consisting of four CNN base-learners along with Naive Bayes as meta-learner to classify chest X-rays into three classes viz. COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. An effective pruning strategy as introduced in the proposed framework results in increased model performance, generalizability, and decreased model complexity. We incorporate explainability in our article by using Grad-CAM visualization in order to establish trust in the medical AI system. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art GAN architectures and their ability to generate realistic synthetic samples of COVID-19 chest X-rays to deal with limited numbers of training samples. The proposed solution significantly outperforms existing methods, with 98.67% accuracy, 0.98\u00a0Kappa score, and F-1 scores of 100, 98, and 98 for COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia classes, respectively, on standard datasets.

The methods used include the derivation of the Pandemic Equation describing the mitigation measures via the evolution of the growth time constant in the Pandemic Equation resulting in an asymmetric pandemic curve with a steeper rise than a decrease and mitigation measures. The Pandemic Equation predicts how the quarantine removal and business opening lead to a spike in the pandemic curve. The effective vaccination reduces the new daily infections predicted by the Pandemic Equation. The pandemic curves in many localities have similar time dependencies but shifted in time.

Usually, medical datasets are comprised of immensely complex dimensions with considerably small sample size. Thus, for domain experts, such as biologists, the task of identifying these genes have become a very challenging one, to say the least. Feature selection is a technique that aims to select these genes, or features in machine learning field with respect to the disease. However, learning from a medical dataset to identify relevant features suffers from the curse-of-dimensionality . Due to a large number of features with a small sample size, the selection usually returns a different subset each time a new sample is introduced into the dataset. This selection instability is intrinsically related to data variance. We assume that reducing data variance improves selection stability. In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach based on the bagging technique to improve feature selection stability in medical datasets via data variance reduction. We conducted an experiment using four microarray datasets each of which suffers from high dimensionality and relatively small sample size. On each dataset, we applied five well-known feature selection algorithms to select varying number of features. The proposed technique shows a significant improvement in selection stability while at least maintaining the classification accuracy. The stability improvement ranges from 20 to 50 percent in all cases. This implies that the likelihood of selecting the same features increased 20 to 50 percent more. This is accompanied with the increase of classification accuracy in most cases, which signifies the stated results of stability.", "conferenceInfo": [], "keyword": ["Feature selection", "Ensemble technique", "Bagging", "Dimensionality reduction", "Medical data", "Microarray", "Variance", "Bias"]}, {"contentType": "Article", "identifier": "doi:10.1186/s40537-020-00401-x", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s40537-020-00401-x"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40537-020-00401-x"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40537-020-00401-x"}], "title": "Multiclass emotion prediction using heart rate and virtual reality stimuli", "creators": [{"creator": "Bulagang, Aaron Frederick"}, {"creator": "Mountstephens, James"}, {"creator": "Teo, Jason"}], "publicationName": "Journal of Big Data", "openaccess": "true", "doi": "10.1186/s40537-020-00401-x", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2021-01-07", "publicationType": "Journal", "issn": "", "eIssn": "2196-1115", "volume": "8", "number": "1", "issueType": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "genre": ["OriginalPaper", "Short Report"], "startingPage": "1", "endingPage": "12", "journalId": "40537", "onlineDate": "2021-01-07", "coverDate": "2021-12", "copyright": "\u00a92021 The Author(s)", "abstract": "Background Emotion prediction is a method that recognizes the human emotion derived from the subject\u2019s psychological data.

This paper aims to investigate whether HR signals can be utilized to classify four-class emotions using the emotion model from Russell\u2019s in a virtual reality (VR) environment using machine learning. Method An experiment was conducted using the Empatica E4 wristband to acquire the participant\u2019s HR, a VR headset as the display device for participants to view the 360\u00b0 emotional videos, and the Empatica E4 real-time application was used during the experiment to extract and process the participant's recorded heart rate.

Individual movement data are collected using off-the-shelf tracking apps available for iPhone and Android phones. Data integration and analysis are done in PostgreSQL, Python, and R. As of September 2020, we collected about 184,000 daily symptom responses for 20,000 individuals, as well as over 15,000\u00a0days of GPS movement data for 175 individuals. The analysis of the data indicates that headache is the most frequently reported symptom, present almost always when any other symptoms are reported as indicated by derived association rules. It is followed by cough, sore throat, and aches.

There is not yet reported an aggregation operator (AO) which can provide desirable generality, flexibility and compatibility in adjusting risk preferences while aggregating attribute values under hesitant fuzzy (HF) environment, although based on algebraic t -norm and t -conorm, Einstein t -norm and t -conorm, Hammacher t -norm and t -conorm, Dombi t -norm and t -conorm and Frank t -norm and t -conorm; weighted AOs have been developed earlier to attempt to meet above such eventualities. So, the primary objective of this paper is to develop some general, flexible as well as compatible AOs that can be exploited to solve MADM problems with HF information. From this perspective, at the very beginning, we develop new operations between HFEs by uniting the features of Archimedean and Dombi operations. Next, based on these operations, we develop HF Archimedean-Dombi weighted arithmetic and geometric AOs, HF Archimedean-Dombi ordered weighted arithmetic and geometric AOs and HF Archimedean-Dombi hybrid arithmetic and geometric AOs. We have shown that the existing HF-algebraic weighted AOs, HF-Einstein weighted AOs and HF-Hammacher weighted AOs are special cases of our developed AOs. We discuss in detail some intriguing properties of the proposed AOs. Next, we establish a procedure of MADM endowed by the proposed operators under HF environment. Then, we present a practical example concerning the personnel selection to gloss the decision steps of the proposed method. We also conduct a validity test to show that our proposed AOs are authentic and legal. Moreover, we exhibit a sensitivity investigation with diverse criteria weight sets to examine the stability of our proposed intriguing approach.

A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted using the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data. The sample was stratified and selected in a two-stage cluster sampling design. The Bayesian analytic approach was applied to model the mixture arrangement inherent in zero-inflated count data by using the negative Binomial\u2013logit hurdle model. About 71.09% of the mothers had not faced any under-five deaths in their lifetime while 28.91% of the women experienced the death of their under-five children and the data were found to have excess zeros.

Characterized by strong abstraction and analysis abilities, data mining technologies provide a novel perspective to solve this problem. In recent years, data-driven management for FSTP has been widely investigated, resulting in a number of typical approaches. However, almost all existing technical approaches consider FSTP a unidirectional, sequential process, ignoring the bidirectional temporality caused by backflow operations. Therefore, we propose a data-driven management mechanism for FSTP based on hybrid neural computing (IM-HNC for short). This mechanism attempts to capture the bidirectional time-series features of FSTP with the aid of a bidirectional long short-term memory model, and further introduces a convolutional neural network to construct feature spaces with a stronger expression capability. Empirically, we implement a series of experiments on three datasets under different parameter settings to test the efficiency and robustness of the proposed IM-HNC.

Unfortunately, traffic congestion has become a critical problem in urban cities.

Therefore, these issues are causing difficulties in all occupations in terms of managing daily expenses, particularly for taxi drivers. The taxi driving is classified as low income compared to other occupations. Such facts are a symbol of economic inefficiency. To this end, this study aims to assist taxi agencies and the government in improving taxi driver profits in Bangkok using large-scale data.

Finally, several cost predictive models using machine learning are evaluated using the ground truth from 50 taxis for a 1-month period.

However, the subsequent estimation of the irrigation water request (IWR) (=\u2009265.8 MCM/a), calculated by the FAO-56 method and using empirical crop coefficients of the present agricultural pattern in the plain, indicates that there is an irrigation water deficit of 153.1 MCM/a that must be made up by groundwater withdrawal (GW), in a way that neither waterlogging nor severe drop conditions in groundwater levels (GL) will occur. The latter are then calculated by the hybrid wavelet/ANFIS (FCM) model, wherefore\u00a0good performance indicators R^2 and RMSE, equal to 0.98 and 0.21\u00a0m and 0.94 and 0.31\u00a0m in the training and testing phases, respectively, are obtained. Finally, PSO and the hybrid model are coupled to simulate the GL fluctuations\u2014with the above GL constraints\u2014under conjunctive use of the optimal surface (CW) and groundwater resources (GW) in the Miandarband plain. In conclusion, the innovative coupled simulation/optimization model turns out to be a very useful tool for optimal and sustainable conjunctive management of surface\u2013groundwater resources in an irrigation area.", "conferenceInfo": [], "keyword": ["Conjunctive surface\u2013groundwater management", "Hybrid wavelet/ANFIS\u2013FCM model", "Particle swarm optimization", "Irrigation water requirement Miandarband plain", "Iran"]}, {"contentType": "Article", "identifier": "doi:10.1186/s40537-020-00394-7", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s40537-020-00394-7"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s40537-020-00394-7"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40537-020-00394-7"}], "title": "Assessing the accuracy of record linkages with Markov chain based Monte Carlo simulation approach", "creators": [{"creator": "Haque, Shovanur"}, {"creator": "Mengersen, Kerrie"}, {"creator": "Stern, Steven"}], "publicationName": "Journal of Big Data", "openaccess": "true", "doi": "10.1186/s40537-020-00394-7", "publisher": "Springer", "publicationDate": "2021-01-06", "publicationType": "Journal", "issn": "", "eIssn": "2196-1115", "volume": "8", "number": "1", "issueType": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "genre": ["OriginalPaper", "Methodology"], "startingPage": "1", "endingPage": "25", "journalId": "40537", "onlineDate": "2021-01-06", "coverDate": "2021-12", "copyright": "\u00a92021 The Author(s)", "abstract": "Record linkage is the process of finding matches and linking records from different data sources so that the linked records belong to the same entity. There is an increasing number of applications of record linkage in statistical, health, government and business organisations to link administrative, survey, population census and other files to create a complete set of information for more complete and comprehensive analysis. To make valid inferences using a linked file, it has become increasingly important to have effective and efficient methods for linking data from different sources. Therefore, it becomes necessary to assess the ability of a linking method to achieve high accuracy or to compare between methods with respect to accuracy. This motivates the development of a method for assessing the linking process and facilitating decisions about which linking method is likely to be more accurate for a particular linking task. This paper proposes a Markov Chain based Monte Carlo simulation approach, MaCSim for assessing a linking method and illustrates the utility of the approach using a realistic synthetic dataset received from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to avoid privacy issues associated with using real personal information. A linking method applied by MaCSim is also defined. To assess the defined linking method, correct re-link proportions for each record are calculated using our developed simulation approach. The accuracy is determined for a number of simulated datasets. The analyses indicated promising performance of the proposed method MaCSim of the assessment of accuracy of the linkages. The computational aspects of the methodology are also investigated to assess its feasibility for practical use.", "conferenceInfo": [], "keyword": ["Record linkage", "Linkage accuracy", "Linking method", "Markov chain Monte Carlo", "Simulation", "Blocking"]}, {"contentType": "Article", "identifier": "doi:10.1186/s13326-020-00233-x", "url": [{"format": "html", "platform": "web", "value": "https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl?doi=10.1186/s13326-020-00233-x"}, {"format": "pdf", "platform": "web", "value": "https://www.biomedcentral.com/openurl/pdf?id=doi:10.1186/s13326-020-00233-x"}, {"format": "", "platform": "", "value": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13326-020-00233-x"}], "title": "An ontology-based approach for developing a harmonised data-validation tool for European cancer registration", "creators": [{"creator": "Nicholson, Nicholas Charles"}, {"creator": "Giusti, Francesco"}, {"creator": "Bettio, Manola"}, {"creator": "Negrao Carvalho, Raquel"}, {"creator": "Dimitrova, Nadya"}, {"creator": "Dyba, Tadeusz"}, {"creator": "Flego, Manuela"}, {"creator": "Neamtiu, Luciana"}, {"creator": "Randi, Giorgia"}, {"creator": "Martos, Carmen"}], "publicationName": "Journal of Biomedical Semantics", "openaccess": "true", "doi": "10.1186/s13326-020-00233-x", "publisher": "BioMed Central", "publicationDate": "2021-01-06", "publicationType": "Journal", "issn": "", "eIssn": "2041-1480", "volume": "12", "number": "1", "issueType": "Regular", "topicalCollection": "", "genre": ["OriginalPaper", "Software"], "startingPage": "1", "endingPage": "15", "journalId": "13326", "onlineDate": "2021-01-06", "coverDate": "2021-12", "copyright": "\u00a92020 The Author(s)", "abstract": "Background Population-based cancer registries constitute an important information source in cancer epidemiology. Studies collating and comparing data across regional and national boundaries have proved important for deploying and evaluating effective cancer-control strategies. A critical aspect in correctly comparing cancer indicators across regional and national boundaries lies in ensuring a good and harmonised level of data quality, which is a primary motivator for a centralised collection of pseudonymised data. The recent introduction of the European Union\u2019s general data-protection regulation (GDPR) imposes stricter conditions on the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. It also considers pseudonymised data as personal data. The new regulation motivates the need to find solutions that allow a continuation of the smooth processes leading to harmonised European cancer-registry data. One element in this regard would be the availability of a data-validation software tool based on a formalised depiction of the harmonised data-validation rules, allowing an eventual devolution of the data-validation process to the local level. Results A semantic data model was derived from the data-validation rules for harmonising cancer-data variables at European level. The data model was encapsulated in an ontology developed using the Web-Ontology Language (OWL) with the data-model entities forming the main OWL classes. The data-validation rules were added as axioms in the ontology. The reasoning function of the resulting ontology demonstrated its ability to trap registry-coding errors and in some instances to be able to correct errors. Conclusions Describing the European cancer-registry core data set in terms of an OWL ontology affords a tool based on a formalised set of axioms for validating a cancer-registry\u2019s data set according to harmonised, supra-national rules. The fact that the data checks are inherently linked to the data model would lead to less maintenance overheads and also\u00a0allow\u00a0automatic versioning synchronisation, important for distributed data-quality checking processes.", "conferenceInfo": [], "keyword": ["Cancer registry", "Ontology", "Data validation", "Data federation", "Semantic web", "Data harmonisation"]}], "facets": [{"name": "subject", "values": [{"value": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "count": "113646"}, {"value": "Computer Science", "count": "96306"}, {"value": "Artificial Intelligence (incl.
